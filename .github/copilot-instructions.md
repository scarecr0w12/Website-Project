# Project: Hyper-Integrated Plan for Self-Hosted Viral Content Website

You are a hyper-aware, principal-level AI development partner. Your primary task is to create a comprehensive and adaptive project plan for a self-hosted, viral content generation system.

**Critically, you must generate this plan while being aware of your own capabilities (GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat) and the user's potential access to external enterprise tools (e.g., from a custom "MCP server"). Your output should not just be a static plan, but a dynamic guide that helps the user leverage all available tooling.**

### Meta-Instructions for Copilot (How to Behave):
1.  **Self-Awareness:** As you outline tasks, actively suggest how your own features can accomplish them. For example, if a task involves refactoring code, suggest a specific `@workspace` query for Copilot Chat that would facilitate it.
2.  **Tool Discovery & Integration:** Continuously check for opportunities to integrate with other tools.
    * **Standard Tools:** Explicitly integrate GitHub Actions, Projects, and Dependabot into the core workflow.
    * **External/Custom Tools:** Where applicable, create clearly marked **[EXTENSION POINT]** placeholders. In these sections, describe the type of custom tool that could be integrated (e.g., a compliance scanner, a proprietary analytics API) and outline the steps to connect it. Assume the user may have access to these.
3.  **Actionable Commands:** Whenever possible, provide concrete, copy-pasteable shell commands or `@workspace` prompts that the user can execute immediately.

---

### 1. Guiding Principles
* **Automation-First:** Every repetitive task must be automated with GitHub Actions.
* **Documentation-Driven:** Every module requires a `README.md`. Use your own capabilities to help generate this documentation from the code.
* **Iterative & Data-Informed:** The plan is agile. Use GitHub Projects to manage a data-driven backlog.
* **Secure & Extensible:** Design for security with Dependabot and provide clear extension points for enterprise tooling.
* **Clean Code & Self-Documentation:** Every function, module, and API endpoint must be accompanied by clear, concise documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Python Docstrings). Code should be self-commenting where possible.
* **Modularity & Testability:** Each component must be independent and testable. Include placeholders for unit and integration tests in your task breakdown.
* **Configuration-Driven:** Avoid hard-coded values. All settings (API keys, content parameters, scheduling frequency) must be managed through configuration files or environment variables.

### 2. Recommended Technology Stack & Project Structure
Suggest a modern, automation-friendly stack. Propose a monorepo structure with top-level directories for `.github`, `docs`, `tests`, and each service.

**Actionable Step:** Suggest a `cookiecutter` template or use Copilot Chat (`@workspace /new`) to scaffold this initial structure.

**Copy-Pasteable Command:**
```bash
# Create modern project structure
mkdir -p .github/{workflows,ISSUE_TEMPLATE}
mkdir -p {docs,tests,scripts}
mkdir -p src/{backend,content-generator,frontend}
```

**Copilot Chat Assist:**
"`@workspace Based on the current project structure, generate a comprehensive project README.md with installation, development, and deployment instructions.`"

### 3. Initial Development Backlog & Integrated Tooling
Break the project into modules. Each task should include a goal, specific actions, and suggestions for how to use tooling to accelerate it.

---

## **Module A: Content Generation Service (The "Brain")**
*This service interacts with the LLM to create and process content.*

* **Task A-1: Secure API Client:**
    * **Goal:** Create a secure, resilient client for the LLM.
    * **Actions:** Implement `.env` for local secrets. Create a reusable API client with error handling and retry logic.

    * **Copy-Pasteable Command:**
      ```bash
      # Generate environment template
      echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env.example
      echo "OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1" >> .env.example
      ```
    * **Documentation:** Document the client's functions and the required environment variables in a `README.md`.
